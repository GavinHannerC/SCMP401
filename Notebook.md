# SCMP Capstone Project Notebook :bowtie:
#### Coire Gavin-Hanner
#### Advisor: Jim Skon

## Overall Goals: 
1. Digitize the output of the GC instrument in the Chemistry Department :pencil: --> :tv:
2. Standardize and analyze the digital output of the instrument
3. Design a user-interface for instrument users to utilize the data

## Research Specs of GC
#### Goal: 
Learn the specifications of the instrument so I can determine what hardware I will need.
#### Process:
Talk with Dudley to get information
#### Results:
After talking with Dudley, I know that the GC instrument's current ourput gives a difference of voltages. 

#### Conclusions:
The system that I design will need to be able to input a difference of voltage.

## Basic Design of A-->D System
#### Goal:
Design the hardware system that will be used to convert the analog output of the GC instrument to digital information.

#### Process:
This will involve meeting with Skon. This will also probably require deciding on the way users will utilize the information.

#### System:
1. Arduino to input the voltage difference
2. Raspberry Pi to interact with the user and send the information to the server
3. Server to analyze the data
4. Website that allows the user to access the data
#### Required Materials:
1. Arduino
2. Raspberry PI
